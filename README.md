Version Control with Git Project

Introduction:
This project covers the basics of version control using Git. It includes setting up a Git repository, learning fundamental Git commands such as branching, committing, merging, and resolving conflicts.

Commands and Explanations:

1. Initialize a Git Repository:
   Command: git init
   Explanation: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden .git directory to store version control information.

2. Add Files to the Repository:
   Command: git add .
   Explanation: Adds all files in the current directory to the staging area, preparing them to be committed to the repository.

3. Commit Changes:
   Command: git commit -m "Initial commit"
   Explanation: Commits the changes in the staging area to the repository with a descriptive message.

4. Branching:
   Command: git checkout -b feature_branch
   Explanation: Creates a new branch named feature_branch and switches to it, allowing you to work on a new feature or experiment independently.

5. Make Changes:
   Explanation: Make changes to your files.

6. Commit Changes to the Branch:
   Commands:
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "Add feature"
   Explanation: Adds and commits the changes made to the branch feature_branch.

7. Merging:
   Commands:
   - git checkout main
   - git merge feature_branch
   Explanation: Switches to the main branch and merges changes from the feature_branch into it.

8. Resolving Conflicts:
   Explanation: Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge process by editing the conflicted files and using the git add . command to stage the resolved changes.

9. Push Changes to GitHub (Optional):
   Commands:
   - git remote add origin <repository_url>
   - git push -u origin main
   Explanation: Adds a remote repository on GitHub and pushes changes from the local repository to the remote repository's main branch.

Additional Commands:

- Check Repository Status:
  Command: git status
  Explanation: Shows the current status of the repository, including changes that are staged for commit and untracked files.

- View Commit History:
  Command: git log
  Explanation: Displays a log of commits, showing the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

- Create a New Branch:
  Command: git branch <branch_name>
  Explanation: Creates a new branch with the specified name but does not switch to it.

- Switch Branches:
  Command: git checkout <branch_name>
  Explanation: Switches to the specified branch.

- Delete a Branch:
  Command: git branch -d <branch_name>
  Explanation: Deletes the specified branch.

- Update Local Repository with Remote Changes:
  Command: git pull origin main
  Explanation: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

- Undo Local Changes:
  Command: git checkout -- <file>
  Explanation: Discards changes made to a specific file, reverting it to the last committed state.
